## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Example Output:
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### Example Output:
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303

- No external libraries needed (only uses built-in `math` module)
